  h3 Description
  p Starting with the page designed in the Bootstrap 1 lab (the files are again provided in the 'before' folder), adapt it to be responsive.
  ul
    li Include a link to the bootstrap-responsive.css stylesheet.
    li Resize the browser's window and check the layout changes. These come from the default media queries implemented in the responsive version of Bootstrap.
    li In order to make the layout fluid, change the <b><code>.row</code></b> classes of the <code>.marketing</code> div by <b><code>.row-fluid</code></b>. 
    li Check that the layout is not fluid yet. This is due to the container <code>div</code>, with class <b><code>.container</code></b>, since its width is absolute (despite it changes through media queries). Change the class to <b><code>.container-fluid</code></b>.
    li The <code>.container-fluid</code> div takes the whole width of the body. In order to avoid this, add a <b><code>max-width</code></b> rule for the inner divs (<code>.marketing</code> and <code>.big-title</code>). It is also possible to add a <code>.wrapper</code> class to the <code>.container-fluid</code> div and style it.
    li In order to make the navigation bar responsive, wrap the <b><code>.nav</code></b> list inside a <b><code>.nav-collapse</code></b> div. Check that the navigation hides when the width of the window is under 980 pixels.
    li Include two script tags for the jQuery library jquery.js and the bootstrap-collapse.js plugin.
    li Add a <b><code>a.btn.btn-navbar</code></b> button inside the navigation bar <code>.container</code>, with the attributes
    pre
      code.html.
        data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".nav-collapse"

  p Now the JavaScript plugin should permit to unfold the navigation bar by clicking this button.
