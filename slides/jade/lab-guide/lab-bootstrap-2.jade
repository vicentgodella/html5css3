  p Use Bootstrap to transform the provided HTML to look similar to the following screenshot:
  p The initial links list should be rearranged in a navigation bar. Bootstrap provides classes for the navigation bar: <b>.navbar</b> and <b>.navbar-inner</b> for the surrounding <div> and <b>.nav</b> for the list of the links. The <b>brand</b> class styles the main link in navigation bar.
  p Several components from Bootstrap should be used: <b>.btn</b> for buttons, <b>.alert</b> for alert dialogues and <b>.progress</b> for progress bars. The rounded border for the text inputs is due to the <b>.search-query</b> class. The button icons are included through empty <b>< i class="icon-..."></b> tags. The details about these classes could be found at:
