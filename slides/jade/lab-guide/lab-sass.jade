  mixin labHeader('Sass: CSS refactoring')

  h3 Important
  p This lab is set as an alternative to <a href="#lab-less">LESS: CSS refactoring</a>. The instructor will indicate which one should be executed.

  h3 Duration
  p 30 minutes

  h3 Description
  p Refactor the provided stylesheet using Sass and the Compass framework.
  p The before folder contains a configured Compass project. To compile, execute in labs/sass/before:
  pre
    code.bash.
      compass watch
  p After this, any change in style.scss will trigger a re-compilation automatically.
  p The CSS stylesheet requires the following changes to remove duplicity: 
  ul
    li <b>Repeated values can be stored in variables.</b> Extract and use variables for colors (backgrounds, shadows, text color) and the width of links.
    li <b>Replace then the values in the stylesheet with variables.</b> This allows also to show relations between magnitudes, such as the line height of a link and its width. These can also be used when calculating the size of the <b><code>.links</code></b> container.
    li Use <b>nested syntax</b> to group the rules of <b><code>.links</code></b>, <b><code>.right</code></b> and <b><code>.left</code></b> in three blocks.
    li Include compass in the stylesheet using <b><code>@import "compass"</code></b>.
    li Use the <b><code>replace-text()</code></b> mixin to perform the image replacements. 
    li Use the <b><code>border-radius()</code></b> and <b><code>box-shadow()</code></b> mixins to avoid writing the vendor prefixes.
  p If in time, use the color functions <b><code>complement()</code></b> or <b><code>darken()</code></b> to transform the color of the links on the left into the right.
