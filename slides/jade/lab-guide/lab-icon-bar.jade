  h3 Description
  p Design a button bar that shows the links as icons, without any text. In order to maintain accessibility and avoid the <i>mystery meat</i>, a <code>title</code> attribute has been included for each link.
  ul
    li Several icon sets are located in the <code>img/</code> folder. The student must choose one of them to use during the lab.
    li Each icon set includes gray-scale and color icons. The latter shall be used for the hover effect of the links.
    li All icons must be arranged in a sprite, generated by <a href="http://www.spritefy.nl">http://www.spritefy.nl</a> (Chrome and Firefox only).
    li The links should have <code>float:left</code> and <code>margin-right:10px</code>.
    li The text should be hidden the following CSS descriptor:
      pre
        code.
          a { 
            width: &lt;icon width>; 
            height: &lt;icon height>; 
            text-indent: 110%; 
            overflow: hidden; 
            white-space: nowrap; 
          }
  p Compare the difference between this technique and the following two:
  pre
    code.css.
      a {
        text-indent: -100000px;
        outline: none;
      }
      a {
        width: 0;
        padding: &lt;height> &lt;width> 0 0;
      }
  p If in time, use a lossless compression tool to reduce the sprite size. Alternatives are <a href="http://pnggauntlet.com/">PNGGauntlet</a> (Windows), <a href="http://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> (Mac OS) or <a href="http://trimage.org/">Trimage</a> (Linux).
